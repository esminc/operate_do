# OperateDo

OperateDo provides a simple way to share the operator (such as `current_user`) of a transaction across different layers.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'operate_do'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install operate_do

## Usage

First, include OperateDo::Operator into the class which represents a operator.

```ruby
class Admin
  include OperateDo::Operator
end
```

`OperateDo::Operator` provides `operate` and `self_operate` methods.

`operate` method takes a block. While the block is being executed, `OperateDo.current_operator` returns current operator, the receiver of this method calling.

```ruby
admin = Admin.new # => #<Admin:0x007ff02b235cf8>

admin.operate do
  OperateDo.current_operator # => #<Admin:0x007ff02b235cf8>
end
```

Since it's a thread-local, you can get it in everywhere. For example, when you call `admin.operate do...` in the rails' controller layer then you can get the `OperateDo.current_operator` from the model layer.

`operate` can be nested, like nested transactions.

```ruby
admin1 = Admin.new
admin2 = Admin.new

admin1.operate do
  OperateDo.current_operator == admin1 # => true
  admin2.operate do
    OperateDo.current_operator == admin2 # => true
  end
  OperateDo.current_operator == admin1 # => true
end
```

OperateDo has a flexible logging mechanism. If you logging with operator, you can use `OperateDo.write` method.

```ruby
admin.operate do
  OperateDo.write 'a resource is being modified'
end

# => I, [2017-10-04T07:13:15.713900 #21515]  INFO -- : 2017/10/04/ 07:13:15 - #<Admin:0x007ff02b235cf8> has operated : a resource is being modified
```

`OperateDo.write` uses `OperateDo::Logger` is a wrapper of Ruby's Logger by default.

You can create your custom logger and use it by setting. A logger class is expected to implement `flush!` method. This method receives an array of `OperateDo::Message`.

Your custom logger class expect and implements `flush!` method.
`flush!` method receive array of `OperateDo::Message`.
A logger class is expected to implement `flush!` method. This method receives an array of `OperateDo::Message`.

```ruby
class StringIOLogger
  def initialize(io_object)
    @io_object = io_object
  end

  def flush!(messages)
    messages.each do |message|
      @io_object.puts [
        message.operate_at.strftime('%Y/%m/%d/ %H:%M:%S'),
        "#{message.operator.operate_inspect} has operated : #{message.message}"
      ].join(" - ")
    end
  end
end
```

And then, set `OperateDo.configure`.

```ruby
logger_string = StringIO.new

OperateDo.configure do |config|
  config.logger = StringIOLogger
  config.logger_initialize_proc = -> { logger_string }
end
admin.operate do
  OperateDo.write 'call in admin blcok'
end

logger_string.rewind
logger_string.read # => 2017/10/04/ 07:47:57 - #<Admin:0x007f9f6695cc40> has operated : a resource is being modified
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
